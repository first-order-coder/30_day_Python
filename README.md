## Overview

**30_day_Python** is a practical, learn-by-building roadmap through Python. It’s organized as bite-sized daily folders (Day_1 … Day_27) that ramp from fundamentals to real-world patterns, then reinforced with mini projects, algorithm drills, scraping pipelines, and a few university-style lab scripts. The goal is momentum: short wins each day, plus optional deep dives when you want them.

This repo suits:
- **Beginners** who want a structured path through core Python (variables, flow control, collections, functions, files, OOP).
- **Refreshers** brushing up on syntax and standard library skills while picking up best practices.
- **Tinkerers** who prefer learning by doing—scraping a page, parsing JSON, pushing a quick analysis to CSV/Excel.

What you’ll find inside:
- **Daily lessons (Day_1 … Day_27):** Progressive exercises covering syntax, conditionals/loops, lists/tuples/sets/dicts, functions & error handling, file I/O, modules, and an intro to OOP and the standard library.
- **FUNCTIONS / LEET / MINI_PROJECTS:** 
  - `FUNCTIONS` collects reusable patterns and utility snippets.  
  - `LEET` (incl. `RecursiveFuncs/`) provides short algorithm challenges to sharpen problem-solving and recursion skills.  
  - `MINI_PROJECTS` ties concepts together into small, runnable apps you can extend.
- **DATA_SCRAPING:** End-to-end scraping patterns using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`, with simple cleaning and export to CSV/Excel—great for building data pipelines and practicing HTTP/HTML parsing.
- **Focused practice days:** 
  - **CoinMarketCap_Api (Day_20)** demonstrates real-API workflows (headers, auth via env vars, parsing JSON, saving results).  
  - **Numpy Functions (Day_24)** explores arrays, slicing, broadcasting, and vectorized operations for speedups over pure-Python loops.
- **University & lab files:** `UNI_WORK`, `UNI_W`, `AC_LAB*.py`, and `Phy_Lab_1.2.py` mirror classroom-style tasks—handy for structured problem sets and reference solutions.
- **Sample data:** `Countries.xlsx` and similar files support exercises that read/write spreadsheets and practice tabular manipulation.

How to use it:
- **Sequential path:** Start at Day_1 and move forward for a smooth learning curve.  
- **Targeted drills:** Jump into `LEET` when you want algorithms, `DATA_SCRAPING` for web data, or `MINI_PROJECTS` when you’re ready to ship something small.  
- **Portfolio-friendly:** Turn a mini project into a CLI or simple app, document your approach, and commit improvements as you learn.

By the end, you’ll be comfortable writing Python scripts from scratch, reading external data, calling APIs, organizing code into functions/modules, and approaching algorithmic problems with confidence.
