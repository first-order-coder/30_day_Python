The Hrabri class con­sist­ed of two sub­ma­rines built for the King­dom of Serbs, Croats and Slo­venes. The first sub­ma­rines to serve in the Royal Yugoslav Navy (KM), they arrived in Yugoslavia on 5 April 1928, and participated in cruises to Mediterranean ports prior to World War II. During the April 1941 Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Hrabri (pictured) was captured by the Italians and later scrapped. Nebojša escaped to Egypt to join the British Royal Navy (RN). She served as an anti-submarine warfare training boat and then as a battery charging station. In May 1942 her crew were removed and placed in a British military camp following a revolt by Yugoslav generals in exile, and she received an almost entirely RN crew. She was briefly utilised for training at Beirut, but was formally handed back to the KM-in-exile in mid-1943. After the war, she was transferred to the new Yugoslav Navy and renamed Tara. She was used in a training role until 1954, then scrapped. (This article is part of a featured topic: Hrabri-class submarines.)
